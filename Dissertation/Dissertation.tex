\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
Multiplayer computer games are becoming very popular, game's success often rests on how enjoyable it is.
Current method of improving player experience is to make sure that all players have equal chance of winning in a game.
For that purpose their skill has to be tracked and teams have to be arranged such that they are of equal strength.

In many popular games several roles have to be filled on each team for optimum performance.
Current algorithms, such as TrueSkill \cite{trueskill}, only track player's overall skill and do not consider what roles the player prefers and how good they are at each one.
This often leads teams being composed of players all wanting to play in the same role, which either leads to team under-performing or some players not enjoying the game as much as they could.
Moreover, I believe that the events that happen in game are more important to many player's experience than the actual outcome.

In addition, I believe that the system can improve overall prediction accuracy since tracking only overall player skill means that games with non-transitive strategies cannot be predicted properly. %TODO Make this clearer
For example, imagine three naive players playing the game of \emph{rock-paper-scissors}.
Player $R$ always plays \textit{rock}, player $P$ always plays \textit{paper} and player $S$ always plays \textit{scissors}.
When two of them play against each other, it is clear to us who will win, but a rating that only tracks overall skill can not predict the outcome properly.

To solve the above problems I wanted to make a system which would be able to predict different events that happen in game by tracking player skill in multiple areas.

\chapter{Preparation}
Since I decided to use machine learning in my project I had to get some background in the area.
Unfortunately, computer science course is in Lent term, therefore I attended a similar course in Engineering department in Michaelmas term, before beginning work on the theory.
