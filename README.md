# Part-II-Personal-Project

 Code for data collection in is 'match_data_collection'
 
 Code for the prototype is in 'data_analysis'
 
 Code for final system is in 'prediction model'
 
 I did not include match data as it is about 300MB, if you decide to test the system, put raw json files in 'all_matches' and update 'match_stats.json'.
