# Sports predictor

 This is a Part II project I have done at uni for my disseration.
 It aims to predict what results different players are gonna get in a match based on their history.
 More information about the whole process in dissertation itself: `Dissertation/Dissertation.pdf`.
 In particular, chapter 3 explains the reasoning behind the model.

 Code for data collection in is 'match_data_collection'
 
 Code for the prototype is in 'data_analysis'
 
 Code for final system is in 'prediction model'
 
 I did not include match data as it is about 300MB, if you decide to test the system, put raw json files in 'all_matches' and update 'match_stats.json'.
 Some of the data I used can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_M9Ypkvw2mhbUhqckRhWFFBMkE/view?usp=sharing).
